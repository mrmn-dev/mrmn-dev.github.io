</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>So I haven't been here in a while and I clearly missed the mark with one of my goals. The goal I have missed is getting organized.</p>
<p>So initially I put the github pages up easy peasy. However I didn't document how I did it. I didn't even save links for the websites that helped me a long. I didn't save the password for the VM that I created to host my github work space. I didn't .. I didn't ... I didn't. So while what I did wasn't difficult figuring out how I went about it was gone. Start over.</p>
<p>So here we are. I saved links and will document soon. One thing learned by starting over is that I am getting a better understanding of what I did earlier. I didn't even understand that earlier my website content, the output from pelican was in a different part of the repository than the input to pelican. The input to pelican was on the source branch and the content was in master. I had not pushed the source branch back to github. Master was pushed as part of publishing the website. Fortunately there isn't much here, so the lost password and VM wasn't a big deal. Maximum Null.</p>                </article>
