The goal I have missed is getting organized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So initially I put the github pages up easy peasy. However I didn't document how I did it. I didn't even save links for the websites that helped me a long. I didn't save the password for the VM that I created to host my github work space. I didn't .. I didn't ... I didn't. So while what I did wasn't difficult figuring out how I went about it was gone. Start over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here we are. I saved links and will document soon. One thing learned by starting over is that I am getting a better understanding of what I did earlier. I didn't even understand that earlier my website content, the output from pelican was in a different part of the repository than the input to pelican. The input to pelican was on the source branch and the content was in master. I had not pushed the source branch back to github. Master was pushed as part of publishing the website. Fortunately there isn't much here, so the lost password and VM wasn't a big deal. Maximum Null.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>It is a start</title><link href="/2018/it-is-a-start.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-15T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-03-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>mrmn-dev</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-03-15:/2018/it-is-a-start.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello and welcome to my github hosted static website.

There isn't much going on right now and since I have a family and a full time job I am not expecting this ever to be non stop action. Hopefully every now and then I do get back here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have some general goals. I am not exactly sure if github can help me with those goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I would like to do is get organized. The value of organization isn't as much as it used to be. Google can find everything for you. However I have not yet been able to get google to find anything I have forgotten. Perhaps this could be a place where I put things as a reminder. Like a note that you take to the grocery store that says "bread, milk, eggs"...the same note week after week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing I would like to do is learn. It would be good to have a little direction in that learning. Organization would help with direction. Look! I am learning a little about github pages and Pelican!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
