There isn't much going on
right now and since I have a family and a full time job I am not expecting this ever 
to be non stop action. Hopefully every now and then I do get back here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have some general goals. I am not exactly sure if github can help me with those goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I would like to do is get organized. The value of organization isn't as much as it used to be.
Google can find everything for you. However I have not yet been able to get google to find anything I have
forgotten. Perhaps this could be a place where I put things as a reminder. Like a note that you take to the
grocery store that says "bread, milk, eggs"...the same note week after week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing I would like to do is learn. It would be good to have a little direction in that learning.
Organization would help with direction. Look! I am learning a little about github pages and Pelican!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
